## About

This NewGRF contains objects made from the sprites of the beautiful "Polish Building Set 0.1", supplemented by several buildings from "Polish Buildings Set 1.4.0" and by some newly drawn sprites.
All buildings have their snow variants, making this object set wholly snow-aware.

Additionally, some objects feature elements that are recoloured either by a random company colour or the player's company colour (see [Parameters](#parameters)).

## License

The combined work, including modifications and additions, is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL v2).

The sprites have been adapted from two sources:

1. "_Polish Building Set 0.1_" by TadeuszD, licensed under _GPL v2_.
2. "_Polish Buildings Set 1.4.0_" by Sojita, licensed under _CC-BY-SA v3.0_.

That presents a challenge in figuring out how to combine these two licenses. Both require derivative works to be licensed under their respective terms, which makes them incompatible in a straightforward manner.

I had been unable to contact the author(s) of "Polish Buildings Set 1.4.0" during the development of this NewGRF, so the following solution was devised.

Since GPL v2 is stricter in terms of freedom and source code availability, and considering it requires derivative works to also be GPL v2, I decided to license the NewGRF under GPL v2.
This way, it adheres to the stricter license, which should encompass the requirements of the CC-BY-SA v3.0.
